# My Portfolio (2022)

This project was built with React.js and Node.js. The mail link is provided by an Express service I created, deployed on EB, which sends the contact form data to my email via AWS SES. This service is not a public repository due to security concerns.

## Build Process

On January 18th I started the build of the portfolio with wireframing. The first iteration went live on the 25th.

## Designs

I wireframed the initial designs for the pages of the application with AdobeXD.

## Build

The app is just a basic React, JS application. The project display is simply handled with CSS & state. Front-end deployed on AWS. Continuous delivery handled with git.

## Updates

Updates continue. Want to create more dynamic effects based on project selection.
